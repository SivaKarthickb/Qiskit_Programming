**Installing the qiskit_textbook Package**

The Qiskit Textbook provides some tools and widgets specific to the Textbook. This is not part of Qiskit and is available through the qiskit_textbook package. The quickest way to install this with Pip and Git is through the command:

pip install git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-textbook.git#subdirectory=qiskit-textbook-src

To check the version installed in your computer, run the following in Python shell or Jupyter Notebook:

import qiskit
qiskit.__qiskit_version__
